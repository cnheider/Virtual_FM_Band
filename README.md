Track 1        Track 2        Track 3        Track 4       Track n

   |--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|         
                                                                        
   <---------------------------------------------------------->         
88.7Mhz                  virtual frequency                108.0Mhz      
                                                                        
```

Technically, it's a mixer with multiple tracks that takes care of the volume of each track (fade in / fade out) while moving along the virtual frequency.
